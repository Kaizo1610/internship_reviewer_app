# Group Project
## Project Initiation

**1. Title:**
Internship Reviewer Application (INTERNOVA)

**2. Background of the problem** 

- Interns often don’t receive consistent or organized feedback on their performance.
- Interns lack clear channels to communicate with mentors or supervisors.
- Internship assessments vary widely, leading to unfair evaluations.
- It’s difficult for both interns and employers to track progress and achievements during the internship.

**3. Purpose or objective**

The purpose of INTERNOVA is to improve the internship experience for both interns and employers by:  

1. **Providing Clear Feedback:**  
   Supervisors can fill out simple feedback forms to give interns structured information about their strengths and areas for improvement.  

2. **Enhancing Communication:**  
   Interns can use built-in messaging tools to send questions or updates directly to their supervisors.  

3. **Ensuring Fair Reviews:**  
   A standardized evaluation system is used for all interns to ensure consistency and fairness in assessments.  

4. **Tracking Progress:**  
   A progress dashboard helps interns and employers monitor completed tasks, achievements, and skill development in real time.

### Example Scenario  

An intern submits a project through the platform. 

The supervisor:  
- Completes an evaluation form with comments and a score.  
- Sends feedback directly to the intern.  

The intern:  
- Views the feedback on their dashboard.  
- Replies with questions or clarifications through the messaging feature.  
- Check their progress on a visual chart.  

Both parties stay updated and aligned on the intern's performance and goals throughout the internship.
