# Case Study 1
## Project Initiation

**1. Title:**
Internship Reviewer Application (INTERNOVA)

**2. Background of the problem** 

- Interns often donâ€™t receive consistent or organized feedback on their performance.
- Interns lack clear channels to communicate with mentors or supervisors.
- Internship assessments vary widely, leading to unfair evaluations.
- Itâ€™s difficult for both interns and employers to track progress and achievements during the internship.

**3. Purpose or objective**

The purpose of INTERNOVA is to improve the internship experience for both interns and employers by:  

1. **Providing Clear Feedback:**  
   Supervisors can fill out simple feedback forms to give interns structured information about their strengths and areas for improvement.  

2. **Enhancing Communication:**  
   Interns can use built-in messaging tools to send questions or updates directly to their supervisors.  

3. **Ensuring Fair Reviews:**  
   A standardized evaluation system is used for all interns to ensure consistency and fairness in assessments.  

4. **Tracking Progress:**  
   A progress dashboard helps interns and employers monitor completed tasks, achievements, and skill development in real-time.  

---

### Example Scenario  

An intern submits a project through the platform. 

The supervisor:  
- Completes an evaluation form with comments and a score.  
- Sends feedback directly to the intern.  

The intern:  
- Views the feedback on their dashboard.  
- Replies with questions or clarifications through the messaging feature.  
- Check their progress on a visual chart.  

Both parties stay updated and aligned on the intern's performance and goals throughout the internship.

**4. Target user** 

The **INTERNOVA** platform is designed for the following groups:  

1. **Interns:**  
   - Receive structured feedback and track progress.  
   - Communicate effectively with mentors or supervisors.  
   - Understand strengths, weaknesses, and areas for improvement.  

2. **Supervisors and Mentors:**  
   - Provide consistent and fair evaluations using standardized templates.  
   - Track intern performance and communicate through a centralized platform.  

3. **HR Teams or Internship Coordinators:**  
   - Oversee the progress and performance of all interns.  
   - Ensure evaluations are fair, consistent, and aligned with organizational policies.  

4. **Employers or Organizations:**  
   - Streamline the internship evaluation process and enhance the overall experience.  
   - Identify high-performing interns for potential future opportunities.
</br>

**5. Preferred platform** </br>
With Firebase serving as the back-end, Internova will use Flutter for cross-platform development with an eye towards Android. This strategy complies with market trends for affordable, high-performing mobile solutions while guaranteeing accessibility for students and young professionals. It has responsive features like document sharing, progress monitoring, and real-time feedback and is portable.
